Computes a composite measure. Raw scores are standardized to z-scores
that are then summed together within each participant. This score is
divided by the square root of the sum of the variances and covariances
of all the subtests (Crocker & Algina, 1986; McMurray, Samelson, Lee, & Tomblin, 2010; Pivneva, Palmer, & Titone, 2012).
